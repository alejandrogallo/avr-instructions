The AVRASM2 preprocessor is modeled after the C preprocessor, with some
exceptions:
.IP \[bu] 2
It recognizes all integer formats used by AVRASM2, i.e.,
\f[C]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $abcd\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \f[] and
\f[C]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0b011001\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \f[] are recognized
as valid integers by the preprocessor and can be used in expressions in
\f[C]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ #if\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \f[] directives.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \[aq].\[aq]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \f[] and
\f[C]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \[aq]\@\[aq]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \f[] are allowed
in identifiers.
\f[C]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \[aq].\[aq]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \f[] is required
to allow preprocessor directives like
\f[C]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \[aq].dw\[aq]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \f[] to be used
in preprocessor macros,
\f[C]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \[aq]\@\[aq]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \f[] is required
to handle assembler macro arguments correctly.
.IP \[bu] 2
It recognizes assembler\-style comment delimiters (
\f[C]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \[aq];\[aq]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \f[] ) as well as
C\-style comments.
Using \f[C]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \[aq];\[aq]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \f[] as a
comment delimiter is in conflict with the C use of
\f[C]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \[aq];\[aq]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \f[] , and it is
therefore not recommended to use assembler\-style comments in
conjunction with preprocessor directives.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[C]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ #line\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \f[] directive is
not implemented
.IP \[bu] 2
Variadic macros (i.e., macros with variable number of arguments) are not
implemented.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[C]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ #warning\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \f[] and
\f[C]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ #message\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \f[] directives are
not specified in the ANSI C standard.
