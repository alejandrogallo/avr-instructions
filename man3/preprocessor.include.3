.SS  () Description
.PP
Include a file.
The two forms differ in that (1) searches the current working directory
first, and is functionally equivalent with the assembler
INCLUDE (avrassembler.wb_directives.html#avrassembler.wb_directives.INCLUDE)
directive.
(2) does not search the current working directory unless explicitly
specifying it with an \[lq]\&.\[rq] entry in the include path.
Both forms will search a built\-in known place after any explicitly
specified path, this is the location for the partdef.inc include files
supplied with the assembler.
.PP
It is strongly discouraged to use absolute pathnames in
\f[C]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ #include\ \ \ \ \ \ \f[] directives, as this makes it
difficult to move projects between different directories/computers.
Use the
\-I (avrassembler.wb_Command_Line_Options.html#avrassembler.wb_Command_Line_Options.I)
to specify the include path, or set ut up in Atmel Studio \- Project \-
Assembler Options .
