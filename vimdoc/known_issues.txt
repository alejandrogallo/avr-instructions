        *known_issues-issue-4146-line-continuation-doesn-t-work-in-macro-calls*
Issue #4146: Line continuation doesn’t work in macro calls ~

The following program illustrates this issue.
>
  .macro m 
  ldi @0, @1 
  .endm m r16,\ 0
<
This is not a problem with preprocessor macros ( '#define' ).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  *known_issues-missing-newline-at-end-of-file*
Missing newline at end of file ~

AVRASM2 has some issues if the last line in a source file is missing a newline:
Error messages may refer to wrong filename/line number if the error is in the
last line of a included files, and in some cases syntax errors may result.
Beware that the Atmel Studio editor will not append a missing newline at the
end of a source file automatically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   *known_issues-increment-decrement-operators*
Increment/decrement operators ~

Increment/decrement operators (++/–) are recognized by the assembler and may
cause surprises, e.g. symbol–1 will cause a syntax error, writesymbol - -1 if
that is what is intended. This behaviour is consistent with C compilers. The
++/– operators are not useful in the current assembler, but are reserved for
future use.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              *known_issues-forward-references-in-conditionals*
Forward references in conditionals ~

Using a forward reference in an assembler conditional may cause surprises, and
in some cases is not allowed. Example:
>
  .org LARGEBOOTSTART
  ; the following sets up RAMPZ:Z to point to a FLASH data object, typically
  ; for use with ELPM.
  
  ldi ZL, low (cmdtable * 2)
  
  ldi ZH, high (cmdtable * 2)
  .if ((cmdtable * 2) > 65535)
  
  ldi r16, 1
  
  sts RAMPZ, r16
  .endif
  
  ; more code follows here
  cmdtable: .db "foo", 0x0
<
The reason for this is that the outcome of the conditional will influence the
value of the forward referenced label, which in turn may affect the outcome of
the conditional, and so on.

The following is allowed:
>
  .ifdef FOO 
  nop ; some code here 
  .endif 
  rjmp label ; more code here 
  .equ FOO = 100 
  label: nop
<
In this example FOO is not defined at the point it is used in a conditional.
The use of .ifdef in this situation is allowed, and the conditional is false.
However, the pattern shown above is not recommended because the programmer’s
intention is not clear. The form is intended to allow common constructs like
this:
>
  ; Define FOO if it is not already defined. 
  .ifndef FOO 
  .equ FOO = 0x100 
  .endif
<
Up to and including AVRASM 2.0.30, these situations were not always properly
detected, causing incomprehensible error messages. Starting with 2.0.31,
explicit error messages are given.

Note that with preprocessor conditionals ( '#if/#ifdef' ), the situation is
always well-defined, preprocessor symbols are always undefined until the
definition is seen. and this kind of error will never occur.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  *known_issues-error-messages*
Error messages ~

Sometimes error messages may be hard to understand. Typically, a simple typo in
some instances may produce error messages like this:

'myfile.asm(30): error: syntax error, unexpected FOO'

where FOO represents some incomprehensible gibberish. The referenced
filename/line number is correct, however.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
             *known_issues-defined-incorrectly-treated-as-an-assembler-keyword*
defined incorrectly treated as an assembler keyword ~

The keyword DEFINED(symbol) [8] is recognized in all contexts, it should only
be recognized in conditionals. This prevents DEFINED(symbol) [8] to be used as
a user symbol like a label, etc. On the other hand, it allows for constructs
like ‘.dw foo = defined(bar)’ which it shouldn’t. Note that the preprocessor
and assembler have separate implementations of DEFINED(symbol) [8] . The exact
behaviour of DEFINED(symbol) [8] currently (from 2.1.5) is:

- The preprocessor ‘defined’ keyword only relates to symbols defined with
  '#define' , and correctly does this only in preprocessor conditionals (
  '#if/#elif' ).

- In all remaining code, the assembler’s notion of DEFINED(symbol) [8] is
  used, the correct behaviour would be to only recognize it in assembler
  conditionals ( '.if/.elif' ).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                             *known_issues-preprocessor-issues*
Preprocessor issues ~

- The preprocessor will not detect invalid preprocessor directives inside a
  false conditional. This may lead to surprises with typos like this:

  ``` programlisting

===============================================================================
                                                      *known_issues-if-atmega8*
    if **ATmega8** ~

  //...

===============================================================================
                 *known_issues-elseif-atmega16-wrong-correct-directive-is-elif*
    elseif **ATmega16** //WRONG, the correct directive is #elif ~

  // This will go undetected if **ATmega8** is false //...

===============================================================================
                                                            *known_issues-else*
    else ~

  // when **ATmega8** is false this section will be assembled even if //
  **ATmega16** is true.

===============================================================================
                                                           *known_issues-endif*
    endif ~

  ```

  It is debatable if this is a bug, the behaviour is consistent with the C
  preprocessor.

- Issue #3361: The preprocessor incorrectly allows additional text after
  directives, which may cause surprises, e.g., #endif #endif will be
  interpreted as a single #endif directive, without any error or warning
  message.

- Issue #4741: Assembler conditionals in preprocessor macros don’t work Use
  of the macro defined below will result in different syntax error messages,
  depending on the value of the conditional val (true or false)

  'programlisting #define TEST \ .IF val \ .DW 0 \ .ELSE \ .DW 1 \ .ENDIF'

  The reason for this is that assembler conditionals must appear on a
  separate line, and a preprocessor macro like the above is concatenated into
  a single line.
